## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for our project submitted to the Walmart Sparkathon 2024! ðŸš€

Our project focuses on optimizing warehouse locations for Walmart by predicting demand and minimizing costs across the supply chain. We developed a model that leverages data-driven insights to enhance supply chain efficiency, reduce operational costs, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

### Key Features
- **Demand Prediction**: Forecasts demand for the next 5 years using advanced time series models.
- **Cost Optimization**: Evaluates transportation costs, forecast accuracy, and warehouse utilization to determine optimal locations.
- **Interactive Demo**: Explore the project through our React-based web application, which integrates the model for real-time analysis and visualization.
